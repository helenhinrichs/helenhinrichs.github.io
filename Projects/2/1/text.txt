<h2 style="text-align: left;">About the project</h2>
<br>
In the second semester at the University of Applied Science Salzburg I had the pleasure to build my first game.<br>
Because I love music and composing as well as nature, I decided to combine these topics.<br>
I wanted to create a game which enables the player to play music in real time and make this as challenging 
as playing real music instruments. But it should be even more important to listen carefully to the melodies around you to replay it later.
