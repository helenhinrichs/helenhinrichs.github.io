A little robot sent to space returns to his homeland to find it in ruins overruled by evil robots, 
who are omnipresent forces responsible for its destruction. They have made the earth into an inhabitable cataclysmic decline. 
The robot has to battle environmental ruin, technological control, and oppression, having magnetic abilities, which enable him 
to stick to surfaces and overcome different types of obstacles. His goal is to reach a safe land and find peace.
