<h2 style="text-align: left;">About the project</h2>
<br>
In the third semester I built my second (non-game-jam) game together with a team mate.<br>
Because he was into music like me, we decided to build a game with a strong focus on music. But to not recreate "Symphonic Forest",
I decided that it had to differ from my first game. 
<ul>
    <li>Instead of recreating melodies, the goal should be to destroy them this time.</li>
    <li>Instead of hard-coding notes, my personal goal was to find a way to read music file formats like MIDI.</li>
    <li>Reading files should enable the player to add custom "levels"/melodies to the game.</li>
    <li>Instead of jumping and placing notes the core mechanics of the player character should be shooting and avoiding being hit by notes.</li>
</ul>
