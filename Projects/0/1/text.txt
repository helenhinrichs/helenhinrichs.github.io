<h2 style="text-align: left;">Pesto vs. tomato sauce</h2>
<br>
This project was created during the Mmarmalade Game Jam at the FH Salzburg.<br>
I was responsible for programming. <br><br>

Pesto or tomato sauce? That's the question! Especially if you have to use one of them as your ammunition! 
Shoot your opponent to let the world know what's the best way to have pasta! But beware of rain clouds, because as everybody knows, 
you simply cannot shoot with a wet noodle! 
<br><br>So what are you waiting for?<br><br>
Get your maccaroni and fight for the honor of good taste!
