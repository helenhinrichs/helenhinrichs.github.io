<h2 style="text-align: left;">My role in the project</h2>
<br>
Because you build your game in the 2nd semester all on your own without having other teammates, I was programming,
composing, mixing audio, creating assets and animations. (Besides the main character.) I could have
used free assets from the internet. But on one hand sometimes it needs more time to find graphics and sounds matching exactly 
what you imagine than creating them on your own and on the other hand I am always excited to achieve new skills in various areas by
learning to use new tools. At the same time creating assets makes me relax so I can focus better when I get back to programming.
